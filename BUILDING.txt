How to build/install
--------------------

Prerequisites:

* zlib (usually preinstalled on Linux or OS X)
  Download via http://www.zlib.net/
  Extract alongside psdparse directory, see Makefile
* libpng
  Download via http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html
  On OS X or Win32 (MinGW tools), Makefile statically links.
  Extract alongside psdparse directory.

If your system has these libraries as shared library packages,
you can use those with appropriate changes to the Makefile.

Mac OS X users: the Developer Tools must be installed 
(see the CDs that came with your Mac, or download from 
http://developer.apple.com/tools/download/).


General build instructions (from tarball)
--------------------------

	$ ./configure
	$ make
and to put the program in a usual install directory:
	$ make install

(This should also work for Cygwin, but is untested.)

See './configure --help' for standard GNU options, such as changing 
the program's final resting place, or compiler, or compiler options.


Build from repository (Subversion checkout)
---------------------

	$ automake -a -f --foreign
	...then follow steps for "General build instructions"


Quick build instructions for OS X
---------------------------------
Install Subversion from package at http://metissian.com/projects/macosx/subversion/
or http://downloads.open.collab.net/binaries.html

Then:
	$ curl http://superb-west.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/libpng/libpng-1.2.16.tar.bz2 |tar -xjvf -
	$ curl http://www.zlib.net/zlib-1.2.3.tar.bz2 |tar -xjvf -
	$ svn checkout http://telegraphics.com.au/svn/psdparse/trunk psdparse
	$ cd psdparse

1. build using the supplied Makefile:
	$ make -f Makefile.unix


Cross-build Win32 EXE from OS X or Linux
----------------------------------------
	
The supplied Makefile is also the easiest way to CROSS-build for Win32,
if you have MinGW installed;
	$ make -f Makefile.unix exe

See the Makefile for more information and prerequisites.

This may also work in MinGW and Cygwin on Windows.


Building with MPW (Mac OS 7,8,9,Classic)
----------------------------------------
An MPW makefile is provided. Simply Build Program "psdparse".


Building on Windows
-------------------
Use Cygwin http://cygwin.com/, MinGW http://mingw.org/,
or upgrade to Linux. Alternatively, the code can probably be built 
with a freely downloadable toolset such as:
* http://www.borland.com/products/downloads/download_cbuilder.html
* http://www.openwatcom.org/download/download_licenses.html
* http://www.digitalmars.com/download/dmcpp.html
